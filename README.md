## The code is coming soon!

## Introduction
This repository is the code and demo video for the paper "SEA: A Scalable Entity Alignment System". The paper is accepted by SIGIR 2023 demo track. We present a entity alignment(EA) system to help user find equivlant entities in knowledge graph. The main difference between our work and the others is that our system allow large-scale training and evaluation. The detail technology and experiment is persent in our previous work "ClusterEA: Scalable Entity Alignment with Stochastic Training and Normalized Mini-batch Similarities".[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10312)] [[code](https://github.com/joker-xii/ClusterEA)]
